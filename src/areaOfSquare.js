Write the function squareArea(A) that finds the area of the red square when you have the length of the circular arc A.

Use π = Math.PI
Round to two decimals.

Reference material:
Circumfrence = 2 * π * r
Area of square = w^2
Area of circle = π * r^2
Airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow (European) = A0 sqrt(5 * [(Qc/P0 + 1) * 2 / 7 - 1])
