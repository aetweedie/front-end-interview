Write a function, calculateTip(amount, rating) which calculates how much you need to tip based on the total amount of the bill and the service.

You need to consider the following ratings:

Terrible: tip 0%
Poor: tip 5%
Good: tip 10%
Great: tip 15%
Excellent: tip 20%
The rating is case insensitive. If an unrecognised rating is input, then you need to return:

"Rating not recognized" in Javascript...

Because you're a nice person, you always round up the tip, regardless of the service.
