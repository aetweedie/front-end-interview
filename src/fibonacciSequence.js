In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, and characterized by the fact that every number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding ones:[1][2]
[1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...]

Write a function that takes the index of a value in the sequence as an argument, and
returns the value at the specified index. 

For example
	Fibonacci(2)
		=> 2

Remember that the array of fibonacci numbers is 0 indexed, so the first element starts at 0.
