## Here are some problems

1. Branch master and name the branch with your name.
2. Complete the problems in ```/src``` on your branch. (You may use any docs or resources Google has to offer, no copypasta. I use VScode, launch with ```code .``` use Vim or Nano if you don't like these for your editor.)
3. Test your work by running ```npm test```.
4. Commit to your branch.
5. Create a merge request to master.
6. ???
7. Profit.
